                    <p>
                        KeyByte has received a Trask award from the Office of Technology
                        Commercialization (OTC) of Purdue University for further development of
                        its product portfolio and commercialization. This was awarded based on a
                        written proposal and then an oral presentation by us as finalists. The
                        presentation was evaluated by a set of judges from private companies in
                        addition to OTC. Three winners were announced by Dr. Abhijit Karve,
                        Director of Business Development at OTC in May.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This award will let us continue the momentum of development of the
                        OptimusCloud product, the zero-configuration NoSQL database. In
                        addition, we will be developing a serverless computing-based product.
                        This award will let us keep the current developer team and add to it.
